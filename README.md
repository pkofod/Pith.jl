If you've ever broken a piece of Elder in two, you've seen its pith: the low density
material in the middle of the branch.

Pith.jl is a super simple, light weight kernel density estimation package. It's
for you who doesn't want to write the same helper functions all over again. Well,
it's mostly for myself, but grab it if you need it!
